## 1. Introduction & Background  
The study of celestial bodies and their movements has fascinated humanity for centuries. With advancements in technology, we now have the ability to visualize and understand the behavior of solar system objects in an interactive and dynamic way. This project focuses on creating a web application that provides a detailed, real-time view of the solar system and Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). By visualizing planetary movements, asteroids, and comets, the project aims to provide an educational platform for users to explore our solar system and its dynamic components.

## 2. Features  
- **Real-time Visualization:** Dynamic, interactive orrery model showcasing the solar system with real-time updates for NEOs and planetary positions.  
- **Interactive Model:** Zoom, pan, and navigate to focus on specific celestial bodies such as planets and asteroids.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and account management via Firebase Authentication.  
- **Data Integration:** Real-time data fetched from external APIs for accurate, up-to-date celestial information.  
- **User Interface:** Intuitive and user-friendly design for easy exploration.

## 3. Methodology  
1. **Data Collection:** Fetch real-time data on NEOs, planets, and their movements via external APIs.  
2. **Frontend Development:** Build the interactive orrery model using Flutter integrated with live data.  
3. **Backend Development:** Use Node.js for API integration and Firebase communication.  
4. **User Authentication:** Implement Firebase Authentication for secure access.  
5. **Deployment & Containerization:** Use Docker to containerize and deploy the application on cloud platforms.  
6. **Testing & Optimization:** Ensure seamless performance across devices and browsers.

## 4. Technologies Used  
- **Flutter** – Frontend development and rendering of interactive orrery  
- **Firebase** – Authentication and real-time database management  
- **Node.js** – Backend API integration and logic  
- **JavaScript** – Backend and API request handling  
- **Firestore** – Storing real-time planetary and NEO data
